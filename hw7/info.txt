*_HOMEWORK FOR WEEK 7_*
Basic: regenerate a ton of figures (> 50) showing data in *2D or 3D* with at least *4* features at a time, 
leveraging things like colour, size, shape, etc...  You can determine how you choose these columns based on 
conceptual understanding of your dataset, or generating all possible combinations! Push your script and figures to Github, 
and please make sure the figures have titles, axis labels, and legends.
Intermediate: from all your figures, tell me the *best* one for interpreting your data, and 
justify why by explicitly comparing it to some other figures! :tada:  
(for anyone who likes, sports, the :goat: figure... for those who wonder what goat means, 
it’s ‘greatest of all time’ :upside_down_face:). Submission should be in the form of text in your README.md file that 
explicitly says the file name within your repo of whatever figure you chose, an explanation of why (in a few sentences), 
and the mention of a few other figures that you didn’t choose and why.
Reach: return to Docker, and package your script inside a Docker container that can be run on your data file through *volume mounting*

As always, please include instructions for how to run your code in your readme.
Regarding Docker, please use the #docker channel since we’re all having the same issues :smile:

See you next week!!! (edited)
