# week 7 homework


The graph I picked is the first one that contains Proline

Alcohol_Alcalinity of Ash_Flavanoids_Hue_Proline


Any graph with Proline shows a separation of the cultivators.


I decided to try plotly.  I did the assignment with Scatterplot from PLOTLY.
It worked.  I got the graphs.

I had a lot of problems with Docker and PLOTLY.
I tried so many times and my image became 2GB.
So this Dockerfile i have was a failed attempt.
It does not work.

And now i have messed up my environment the python script with plotly won't run.
It did run a few days ago.  So now i have to fix my environment.
